Questions
 1) Describe the variables `flow`, `year`, `month`, and `day`. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?\

    These variables are all lists and are composed of integers, float values, and str types. 
 The length is the same for all of these lists= 11577


2) How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

     The daily flow for the month of september exceeded my prediction 937 times. This is out of a total of 941 data points. This gave a 99.5% occurance of exceeding a flow of 43 for all data collected for the months of September since 1989 

3)   How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

        My flow predicition was exceeded 100%, or 360 times out of 360 for data collected for the month of september from 1989-2000. For flow values equal to or after year 2010 my prediciton was exceeded 98% or 307 out of 311 times....I am starting to think I may have made a bad prediction :)

 4.    How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

         Comparing the two averages from the first half of September compared to the last half of septemebr shows a difference of about 10cfs decrease. The beginning month average (up to 9/15) was 178.9. The end of the month (after9/15) was 169.8. This shows a slight decrease in flow. 

5) How did I choose my numbers this week?---For coming up with my stream prediciton the week I did not do anything too analytical for my inputs. I looked at some average flow values for the month of Septemebr and compared that to the daily flow rates USGS is reporting for this past week up to Saturday. My guess seems really low compared to the average historical flow for September. The homework this week also shows how out of range my predicition is compared to data in my txt file. It will be interesting to see if my hunch is close to the average reported.
