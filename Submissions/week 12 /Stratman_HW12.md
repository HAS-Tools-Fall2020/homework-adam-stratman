### 1. A brief summary of the how you chose to generate your forecast this week.

I chose to use a combination of my AR model and educated guess for the second week forecast. I incorporated the air temperature into my linear regression by adding it in as a variable.

### 2. What is the dataset? Why did you choose it?

The dataset I added is air temperature. I chose it because it is one of the other relevant datasets to consider when analyzing streamflow. I likely would have included precipitation data if it would not have been the example used in the starter code.

### 3. What is the spatial and temporal resolution and extent of the data ?

The spatial resolution of the dataset is from 34N to 36N latitude and 247E to 249E longitude. The temporal resolution is from 2010-01-01 to 2020-11-09. The air temperature is collected four times a day with an average value taken from these.

### 4. Where did you get the data from?

The data came from the physical sciences laboratory website using the NCEP reanalysis daily averages search option.

### 5. What was your approach to extracting and aggregating it into something useful to you?

This air dataset followed the same organization as the precip data in the starter code. I followed the directions for extracting the data. Once I had it in an easy to use datetime format I used the previous two weeks average air temp value. I then converted this to Fahrenheit as it was reported in kelvin, and added it into my linear regression as another variable and multiplied it by the model coefficient.
