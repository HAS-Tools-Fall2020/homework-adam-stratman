## Assignment questions

Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

This week I decided to look at the average end of month flows for September to make my prediciton. I took into consideration the whole set of data from 1989-present, 2015-present, and just flow from Septemebr 2019. I then looked at the quantiles for the last five year dataset. Taking into consideration this last weeks average and looking at where the flow is currently, I decided to predict 60 CFS. 

Describe the variable flow_data:

What is it?

It is a numpy array (flow_data)

What type of values is is composed of?

It is composed of 64 bit floats 

What is are its dimensions, and total size?

There are two dimension to this data, consistiing of four columns and 11582 rows = 46328 total 

How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

In the month of september, the flow was greater than my prediciton 

893 times and 94% 


How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

exceeding 60cfs in or before 2010 drops down to 360 times with 38% occurance 

exceeding 60cfs in or before 2010 drops down to 285 times with 30% occurance 


How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

Looking at the whole set of data, it appears that the change between the beginning and end of the month of September is only about -8 CFS
