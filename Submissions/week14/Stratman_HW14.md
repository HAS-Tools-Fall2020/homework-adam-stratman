3/3 - Nice work. 


### What is the paper or project you picked? Include a title, a link the the paper and a 1-2 sentence summary of what its about.

The paper I chose utilizes a dataset and processing code to investigate neuron activity during a declarative memory task. You can find the paper here:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0415-9 . This project is based around using a dataset designed by Neuroscience without borders. The purpose is to streamline the type of data these scientists use to make it more accessible and usable by others in the field of neuroscience and to move towards a way of standardizing the multitude of data they utilize.

### What codes and/or data are associated with this paper? Provide any link to the codes and datasets and a 1-2 sentence summary of what was included with the paper (i.e. was it a github repo? A python package?A database? Where was it stored and how?)

The code was made available through a github repo:https://github.com/rutishauserlab/recogmem-release-NWB. The dataset is both python and Matlab compliant.

### Summarize your experience trying to understand the repo: Was their readme helpful? How was their organization? What about documentation within the code itself?

Conceptually the repo made sense, they have taken a multitude of datasets and organized them in a way to be processed in a cohesive workflow. Although it makes sense while reading about it in the readme, with detailed instructions on how to download the proper packages and the workflow, It became less clear once I began opening up the code myself.

### Summarize your experience trying to work with their repo: What happened? Where you successful? Why or why not?

I was able to clone the repo and look at what type of files were present. I was able to install the package the author had made for this specific dataset. I was not able to obtain the raw data used to process and obtain results. The author had deleted the file earlier which was discovered after trying to download the zip file.

### Summarize your experience working with the data associated with this research. Could you access the data? Where was it? Did it have a DOI? What format was it in?

As mentioned above I was not able to access the data. With more time, I see that authors will often put in papers to reach out with any questions regarding data. If more time were permitted I would reach out for the required zip file and go from there.


### Did this experience teach you anything about your own repo or projects? Things you might start or stop doing?

I think the value of the readme is now clear to me and I realize I can elaborate more on how to run my code and what it is doing explicitly. I think I will clear up how the dataset is called into my code as well as add more commenting throughout to help others understand better what is going on. Although this code and research I found was well documented through the readme on how to process and use the code, it was still difficult to follow. With more time and knowledge on the subject it would have likely been easier to run.
